# Twitch.tv Foot Switch Controller

Easy to use 4 button USB controller for Twitch.tv, or any project. I originally designed this to be used for a friend that streams his Speed-Runs in Super Metroid. The fully working unit can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfadq8JCBqg

## Parts Used:
Digispark, generic $2 kind
4 momentary buttons
Lots of wiring and hot glue
OBS (Open Broadcast Software(?))

This could be used as a scene switcher or something similar, I'm not 100% up on the control options in OBS.
